## Web App (`index.html`)

Hosted on GitHub Pages. A single-page tool with a persistent sidebar and multiple pages:

| Page | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Title Generator** | Generates optimized YouTube titles based on your channel niche and competitors |
| **Idea Generator** | Suggests video ideas based on your channel's content strategy |
| **Tracker** | Track competitor channels — monitor their latest videos, view counts, and outlier performance |
| **Bookmarks** | Save and organize videos into folders for later reference |
| **Thumbnail Generator** | Generate and preview thumbnail concepts |
| **Thumbnail Preview** | See how your thumbnail looks in the YouTube feed |
| **Niche Finder** | Discover untapped YouTube niches using analytics data |

### Sidebar behavior
- **Title / Idea pages**: shows your saved channels
- **Tracker**: shows your tracker groups
- **Bookmarks**: shows your folders
- **Thumbnail / Niche pages**: minimal sidebar (settings only)

## Chrome Extension (`chrome-extension/`)

Loaded as an unpacked extension in Chrome. Runs on YouTube and YouTube Studio.

### Features

#### Aged Channel Checker
Runs on `youtube.com`. Detects whether a YouTube channel is newly created ("Zero channel") or established ("Aged channel") based on its join date, and shows a badge on the channel page.

#### Video Tracker & Bookmarks
Runs on `youtube.com`. Injects **Bookmark** and **Track** buttons on video thumbnails and the watch page. Lets you save videos to folders or add them to a tracker group to monitor performance over time.

#### Studio EP Numbers
Runs on `studio.youtube.com`. Automatically reads the episode number from your video filename (e.g. `EP.19 - video-name.mp4`) and displays an editable **EP badge** next to each video in your content list. Keeps your episode numbering organized without manual entry.

#### Video Labels
Runs on `studio.youtube.com`. Adds a clickable **Label** badge next to each video in your content list. Click it to open a dropdown showing all previously used labels as one-click presets, a clear option, and an input to type a new label (e.g. VidRush, Manual, AI, Sponsored). Labels are stored per video ID and synced across devices — lets you see your entire content library's format at a glance without opening each video.

#### Auto Description
Runs on `studio.youtube.com`. Automatically fills in the description field when you open a video for editing. You set up a template per channel in the extension popup — it detects which channel you're on and fills the right template instantly. Templates are synced across all your devices via Chrome Sync.

### Popup
Click the extension icon to:
- **Toggle each feature on/off** — changes take effect immediately on the current page, no refresh needed
- **Manage description templates** — add, edit, or delete per-channel templates
- All settings sync across devices automatically
